# Influent Metrix AWS

This is a repository with code I wrote for uploading and downloading to an AWS S3 bucket using React, Redux, and NodeJs. 

Most of my AWS code can be found in the following files:

/ui/components/importer/data.jsx, /api/modules/importer/importer.js, /ui/components/importer/settings.jsx, ui/components/importer/custom.css (specically the Data Page CSS), and some here api/index.js
